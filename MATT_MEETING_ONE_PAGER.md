## Alternative Structures (For Discussion)

If you'd prefer different terms, here are options:

**Option B: Higher Commission, Lower Equity**
- 5% equity + 30% commission
- More cash upfront, less long-term ownership

**Option C: Performance-Weighted**
- 5% base + up to 10% unlocked by hitting milestones
- All upside is earned, nothing guaranteed

**Option D: True Partnership**
- 33/33/33 split (Seth/Ian/Matt)
- No commission, just equity
- Equal ownership

*(We prefer Option A, but open to discussion)*

- "Vibe coding" is entering mainstream (Karpathy, Rubin, your post)
- No definitive podcast in this space yet

**The window is open. Let's build this.**
