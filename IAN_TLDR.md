# Let's Vibe! — TLDR for Ian

**The pitch:** Weekly podcast where we shoot the shit about vibe coding, interview the most interesting people building with AI, and show tutorials that become standalone clips.

**Why us:**
- We're both deep in it (you with Platters/gallery, me with /vibe)
- We're the only ones old enough to remember the Netscape playbook
- We're both in Paris regularly (Ledger studio = home base)
- Neither of us needs to impress anyone anymore

**Format (45-60 min):**
1. **Opener (10-15 min)** — Seth & Ian catch up: what we built this week, tools we're using, patterns we're seeing
2. **Guest Interview (25-30 min)** — Karpathy, Rick Rubin, Gene Kogan, steipete, Claire Silver types
3. **Tutorial Clip (10-15 min)** — Hands-on walkthrough, becomes YouTube Shorts

**The vibe:**
- Acquired meets Oprah — sophisticated but warm
- NOT: hype, crypto bro energy, empty superlatives
- YES: Rick Rubin calm curiosity meets tech optimism

**Dream guests (our networks combined):**
- Andrej Karpathy (coined "vibe coding")
- Rick Rubin (popularized it via Creative Act)
- Boris Dayma (Anthropic/Claude)
- steipete (Clawdbot)
- Simon Willison (LLM tools)
- Gene Kogan (Abraham.ai)
- Claire Silver, Holly Herndon, XCOPY
- Your Ledger/LVMH/Beats network

**Why now:**
- This moment is Pac-Man eating the cherry — everything is flashing
- We're running back through 30 years creating what we couldn't build before
- People have no idea what's about to come
- The podcast keeps us synced, brings the best people to us, and gives us show & tell

**From our call:**
> "People have no idea what's about to come. These ideas are just going to come out of nowhere now."

**Logistics:**
- Record weekly (remote or Paris studio)
- Launch with 3 episodes (Feb/March 2026)
- Minimal production — Riverside.fm + Descript + Spotify for Creators

**Next step:**
- Review the site: [link TBD]
- Pick a day/time for Episode 1
- Let's vibe.
