## Seth's Story Arc (for Ian to interview)

### Act 1: The Builder (5 min)
- Turntable.fm era - building social music
- ROOT - blockchain before blockchain was cool
- SiteSpecific - AR/location based art
- **Pattern:** Always at intersection of tech + culture

### Act 2: The Vibe Coding Moment (5 min)
- Claude Code launch - something clicked
- Building /vibe as social layer
- The realization: "This isn't just better dev tools, this is cultural shift"
- Comparing to Netscape moment (we've seen this before)

### Act 3: Why Now, Why This Show (3 min)
- Ian + Seth partnership (Rick Rubin connection, Paris studio)
- Mission: Distribute AI superpowers like Tony Hawk building skate parks
- Not for developers - for artists, musicians, designers who want to build
- Weekly format as force function

### Act 4: What We're Building (2 min)
- The show format: Guest + Tutorial + Vibe Check
- The community: Creators, not coders
- Next episode: Seth interviews Ian

## Ian's Interview Questions (Suggested)

These are starting points - chemistry over format:

1. **The Origin:**
   - "Walk me through Turntable.fm - what were you trying to build?"
   - "When did you first feel like you were vibe coding?"

2. **The Moment:**
   - "What clicked with Claude Code that didn't click with GitHub Copilot?"
   - "Tell me about building /vibe - what is it?"

3. **The Pattern:**
   - "You've been building for 30 years - how does this moment compare to Web 1.0?"
   - "What are developers missing about what's happening?"

4. **The Mission:**
   - "Why a podcast? Why now?"
   - "Who is this show for?"

5. **The Partnership:**
   - "How did you and I end up doing this together?"
   - "What makes you excited about weekly shipping?"

## Post-Recording

1. Export separate tracks from Riverside

6. Publish to Spotify for Creators
7. YouTube upload (full + clips)
