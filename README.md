## Origin Story

**Jan 8, 2026** - tez (@thefunnyguysNFT) suggested Seth do a podcast:
> "Honestly, you guys have to do a podcast episode together. It's going to be super inspiring for people in art, we need more ai-optimistic builders who embrace this stuff asap"

Seth's response:
> "I actually think this makes sense on multiple dimensions... for recruiting, fundraising, customer adoption as well as keeping connected to smart artists/technologists we can invite... I have no interest in doing a digital art podcast (shoot me) but what about one we host every week called 'let's vibe!'"

Ameesia's validation:
> "Love that idea. You need a platform to openly speak about everything you're learning. Not just X. One that people can follow and actually learn from. You are very good at speaking about your experiences... You are eloquent and well spoken. Pod cast feels perfect."

## Strategic Value

1. **Recruiting** - Connect with talent
2. **Fundraising** - Build credibility and network
3. **Customer adoption** - Educate potential users
4. **Network** - Stay connected to smart artists/technologists
5. **Platform** - Own your distribution beyond X
