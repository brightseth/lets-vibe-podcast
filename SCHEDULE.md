## Optimal Publishing Day & Time

### Recommendation: **Tuesday at 5:00 AM EST**

**Why Tuesday:**
- Highest download numbers according to Megaphone research
- Business/tech audiences engage most Mon-Tue as they start the week
- Avoids Monday (holiday conflicts) and Friday (weekend dropoff)
- Fewer competing releases than Wednesday (most crowded day)

**Why 5:00 AM EST:**
- Catches East Coast morning commute (8 AM listening peak)
- Available when West Coast wakes up
- European listeners get it by afternoon
- Data shows 5 AM releases get max downloads

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**Time Zone Coverage:**
| Time Zone | Local Time | Context |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| EST | 5:00 AM | Early birds, morning routine |
| PST | 2:00 AM | Ready for morning |
| GMT | 10:00 AM | Mid-morning UK |
| CET | 11:00 AM | Lunch break Europe |

**Consistency is Key:**
Whatever schedule you pick, stick to it religiously. Listeners will expect new episodes at the same time each week. Set up automated publishing in Spotify for Creators.

## Guest Booking Timeline

### Outreach Cadence

**Initial Outreach:**
- Personalized DM or email

**Follow-up Schedule:**
- Day 7: Gentle follow-up if no response
- Day 14: Final follow-up with alternative contact method

### Booking Best Practices

1. **Always have 2 guests ahead** - Never rely on one confirmed guest
2. **Batch outreach** - Send 5-7 invites per wave
3. **Expect 20-30% response rate** - Most won't reply
4. **Book backup dates** - Offer 2-3 time slots
5. **Send calendar invite immediately** after verbal yes
6. **Confirm 48 hours before** - Prevent no-shows
7. **Record buffer content** - Seth + Lukas episodes for emergencies

### Guest Confirmation Email Template

After verbal yes, send within 24 hours:

```

## Recording Buffer Strategy

### Always Maintain a 2-Episode Buffer

After launch, you should always have:
- **1 episode** fully edited and ready to publish
- **1 episode** recorded and in post-production
- **2 guests** confirmed for upcoming recordings

This protects against:
- Guest cancellations
- Your illness or travel
- Technical failures
- Life emergencies

### Emergency Content Options

If you fall behind:
1. **Seth + Lukas Only** - Hosts discuss recent vibecoding news, tools, projects
2. **Community Spotlight** - Feature a project from vibecodings directory
3. **Best Of** - Compile highlights from previous episodes
4. **Q&A Episode** - Answer listener questions
5. **Re-air Classic** - Re-release early episode with new intro
