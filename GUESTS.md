## Outreach Template

### Standard Invite

**Subject:** Let's Vibe! Podcast - Would love to have you on

Hey [NAME],

Seth here. I'm launching a weekly podcast with Lukas Amacher called "Let's Vibe!" - it's for creative people learning to build with AI. Not another tech podcast for developers - this is specifically for artists, collectors, and creatives who want to vibe code.

Your work on [SPECIFIC THING] is exactly the kind of story we want to tell. Would you be up for a ~45 min conversation about [TOPIC]?

Remote friendly, no prep needed - just a good chat about what you're building and thinking about.

Let me know if you're interested and we can find a time.

Best,
Seth

P.S. [PERSONAL NOTE OR CONNECTION]

### For Big Gets (Tier 0)

**Subject:** Quick question about creativity + AI

Hi [NAME],

I've been thinking a lot about [THEIR WORK/BOOK/PROJECT] and how it applies to the new wave of creative tools we're seeing with AI.

I'm starting a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" focused on creative people building with AI - not the technical side, but the human/creative side. Your perspective on [SPECIFIC ANGLE] would be incredibly valuable.

Would you have 45 minutes for a conversation? We'd work around your schedule entirely.

Either way, thank you for [SPECIFIC THING THAT INFLUENCED ME].

Best,
Seth Goldstein
