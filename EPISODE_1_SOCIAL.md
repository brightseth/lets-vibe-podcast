## 1. Launch Tweet Thread (from @seth)

**Tweet 1/7:**
New podcast with @iancr. It's called Let's Vibe!

Episode 1 is about why this moment feels like the Netscape moment. We recorded it with me in NYC and Ian in Italy.

https://letsvibe.fm

**Tweet 2/7:**
I've been in tech for 30 years. Site Specific in 1995. Turntable.fm. Bright Moments. Now building Eden and SOLIENNE.

But I never learned to code. Huge insecurity. I was the business guy who had ideas but needed engineers to build them.

**Tweet 3/7:**
Then Claude Code showed up.

I use this Oliver Sacks analogy: it's like a 55 year old who never played music sits at a piano and plays Rachmaninoff.

That's what it feels like.

**Tweet 4/7:**
When I started building SOLIENNE with Claude, I didn't think about product-market fit. I didn't worry about users or metrics.

Because it was art, I could just make something I believed in.

And it worked.

**Tweet 5/7:**
Fred Wilson told me: "You can't grow corn."

I spent months building an autonomous AI artist anyway. Posted proof of corn on Twitter. Hit #1 on Hacker News.

The corn grows now.

**Tweet 6/7:**
Ian draws the parallel to Pro Tools. Music production used to require expensive studios and engineers. Now anyone can produce an album.

That's where we are with coding. The studio is in your terminal.

**Tweet 7/7:**
Tonight is the 30th anniversary of Silicon Alley.

Ian and I remember when the web browser was a miracle. This feels like that.

"In the beginning was the command line."

## 2. Ian's Companion Thread (from @iancr)

**Tweet 1/4:**
New podcast with @seth - Let's Vibe!

First episode recorded at my dining table in Paris. Seth was sitting there vibe coding, and I realized I was watching something fundamental shift.

**Tweet 2/4:**
I have a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. That degree doesn't exist anymore. But it made sense then - computers were creative tools, not just engineering instruments.

We're coming back to that.

**Tweet 3/4:**
The parallel I keep thinking about: Pro Tools democratized music production. Drake's first mixtape was made on a laptop. TuneCore let him distribute it without a label.

Claude Code is doing that for software.

**Tweet 4/4:**
Rick texts me every day about vibe coding now.

This is happening. Episode 1 with @seth explains why.

**Don't:**

**Vibe:** Rick Rubin. Minimal. Warm. Contemplative. Two friends talking at a table.
