Hey — need to lock in Matt's equity before we circle back to him.

My proposal:

You:   40%
Me:    40%
Matt:  10% + 20% commission on sponsors he brings
Pool:  10% (future producer/editor)

At $500k revenue Year 1:
- You make: $120k
- I make: $120k
- Matt makes: $130k ($100k commission + $30k equity)

Why this works:
• We keep 80% voting control
• Matt gets meaningful equity (not token)
• He's incentivized immediately via commission
• Room to hire help later
• Industry standard for this type of deal

Alternative: 42.5/42.5/10/5 if you want slightly more equity

Thoughts? Once you confirm I'll draft the proposal for Matt.
