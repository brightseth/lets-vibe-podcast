## The Hosts

**Seth Goldstein** — Founder of Turntable.fm, ROOT, SiteSpecific. Building /vibe, a social layer for Claude Code. Based in Tucson + Paris.

**Ian Rogers** — Chief Experience Officer of Ledger. Former CDO at LVMH, founder of Topspin Media, built Beats Music. Interviewed Rick Rubin about The Creative Act on Tetragrammaton. Based in Paris.

**Origin Story:** Ian interviewed Rick Rubin on Tetragrammaton about "The Way of Code: The Timeless Art of Vibecoding" (September 2025). The podcast is a natural extension. Both Seth and Ian have been building things for 30 years — they remember the Netscape moment and see AI as that same inflection point.

## Three-Segment Format

### Segment 1: The Guest (15 min)
High-level thought leader interview. Big picture: creativity, process, philosophy. NOT technical deep dives. Tetragrammaton-style contemplative tone.

Target guests: Rick Rubin, Karpathy, Andre 3000, Boris Dayma types.

Questions to explore:
- How do you think about creativity now vs. 5 years ago?
- What surprised you about working with AI?
- What do you wish more people understood?

### Segment 2: The Vibe Check (15 min)
Seth and Ian shoot the shit. Two friends at a bar.

Recurring segments:
- "What I shipped this week"
- "Tool of the week"
- "Vibe coding fail of the week"
- "What's overrated / underrated"

### Segment 3: The Tutorial (15 min)
Hands-on deep dive. Screencast-friendly — becomes YouTube content. Specific, actionable, replicable. Could be guest, Seth, Ian, or external contributor.

Examples: "How I built X in an hour with Claude"
