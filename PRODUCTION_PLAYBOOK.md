# Let's Vibe! Production Playbook

## Competitive Landscape

### Podcast Comparison

| Podcast | Length | Format | Frequency | Key Insight |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Lex Fridman** | ~3 hours | Long-form interview | Weekly | Non-confrontational deep exploration |
| **Acquired** | ~4 hours | Deep research + conversation | ~8/year | "Conversational audiobooks" - 100 hrs research per ep |
| **Tetragrammaton** | ~2 hours | Long-form interview | Weekly | Rick Rubin's contemplative style |
| **Dwarkesh** | ~2 hours | Deeply researched interviews | Weekly | Focus on AI, science, history |

### Our Differentiation

**We're NOT doing:**
- 3-4 hour deep dives (too long)
- Heavy research episodes (not our strength)
- Pure interview format

**We ARE doing:**
- **45-minute commute-length episodes** (SF to Palo Alto)
- **3-segment format** with distinct value in each
- **Weekly cadence** with minimal production overhead
- **Creative + technical hybrid** audience

---

## The Format: 45 Minutes, 3 Segments

### Segment 1: The Guest (15 min)
**High-level thought leader interview**

- Rick Rubin, Karpathy, Andre 3000, Boris Dayma types

## The Ian + Rick Connection

**Critical context:** Ian already interviewed Rick Rubin on Tetragrammaton (September 2025) about **"The Way of Code: The Timeless Art of Vibecoding"**

From that episode:
- Rick was named one of TIME's 100 Most Influential People in AI
- The "vibe coding" meme went viral and Rick leaned in
- He wrote about applying Tao Te Ching principles to coding
- Ian and Rick explored creativity + technology intersection

**This is our origin story.** Ian literally interviewed Rick Rubin about vibe coding. The podcast is a natural extension.
