# Let's Vibe! Partnership Proposal

**A weekly podcast about creativity in the age of AI**

*Draft for internal review — January 21, 2026*

---

## The Opportunity

Vibe coding is having its Netscape moment. Millions of people have heard the term but don't know how to start. There's no authoritative voice contextualizing what's happening — just scattered tutorials and hype.

**Let's Vibe!** fills that gap: a high-production weekly podcast that makes vibe coding accessible to curious creatives, not just developers.

### The Mission

> "The future is here, it's not evenly distributed—our job is to distribute it evenly."

Like Tony Hawk building skate parks in underserved communities, we're taking AI superpowers to the creative community who needs them most. This isn't about serving the tech elite—it's about democratizing access to tools that unlock human creativity.

**Our 10 Commandments** (see `TEN_COMMANDMENTS.md`): Show don't theorize. Accessible language is respect. Process over polish. No gatekeeping.

## Revenue Model

### Sponsorship Targets

| Tier | Sponsors | Est. CPM |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Platform** | Anthropic, OpenAI, Google | Premium |
| **Infrastructure** | Vercel, Supabase, Replit | $50-100 |
| **Tools** | Cursor, Descript, Riverside | $30-50 |
| **Adjacent** | Notion, Linear, Figma | $25-40 |

**Why sponsors want this:**
- Audience of decision-makers and early adopters
- High intent — people actively learning to build
- Premium positioning alongside Rick Rubin / Karpathy tier guests

### Revenue Split (Proposal)

| Party | Share | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Distribution Partner | 30% | Sponsorship sales, operations |
| Seth + Ian | 50% | Hosts, creative, guest access |
| Production Reserve | 20% | Editing, equipment, travel |

*Alternative: Flat monthly retainer + performance bonus for distribution partner*

---

## Production Model

### Weekly Workflow

```
Monday     → Agent generates guest research + talking points
Tuesday    → Record episode (remote or Ledger studio)
Wednesday  → Edit in Descript, agent generates show notes
Thursday   → Agent generates clips + social content
Friday     → Publish + distribute
```

### Agent Automation

The Let's Vibe Agent handles:
- Guest research and outreach drafts
- Show notes generation from transcript
- Viral clip identification
- Social post drafts for all platforms
- Content calendar management

**Human in the loop:** Hosts approve outreach, review show notes, select clips

---

## Positioning

### Who This Is For

> "Curious creatives who've heard 'vibe coding' but don't know where to start"

- Artists who want to build but never coded
- Founders who want to ship faster
- Executives trying to understand the shift
- Musicians, designers, writers exploring AI tools

### Who This Is NOT For

- Hardcore developers (they don't need us)
- Crypto Twitter / meme coin crowd
- Tutorial junkies (plenty of YouTube for that)

### Tone

**Acquired meets Oprah** — sophisticated but warm, practical not theoretical

**Rick Rubin aesthetic** — contemplative, minimal, high signal

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Podcast | Gap We Fill |
|---------|-------------|
| Latent Space | Too technical, developer-focused |
| Lex Fridman | Not focused on building/making |
| TWIML | Academic, ML research heavy |
| Dwarkesh | Great but not vibe coding specific |

**Our lane:** The intersection of creativity and AI, for makers not researchers.

---

## Content Opportunities

### Underserved Topics

1. **"What is MCP?"** — Nobody explaining it simply
2. **Creative workflow** — How artists are actually using these tools
3. **Business of vibe coding** — Economics, pricing, sustainability
4. **The cultural shift** — Why this feels different

### Recurring Segments

- **Vibe Check** — What we built this week
- **Guest Interview** — Deep conversation with thought leader
- **Tutorial** — Hands-on walkthrough (becomes YouTube content)

---

## Launch Plan

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Jan 27-31 | Record Episode 1: Ian interviews Seth (Ian in Italy next week) |
| Feb 7 | Record Episode 2: Seth interviews Ian |
| Feb 14 | Episode 3: First guest interview |
| Mar | First sponsorship deals |
| Q2 | Scale distribution, add video |

**Episode Format Evolution:**
- Episodes 1-2: Hosts interview each other (establish chemistry, credibility)
- Episode 3+: Start bringing in guests (Rick Rubin, Karpathy, etc.)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Seth + Ian + Partner call** — Align on structure
2. **Term sheet** — Equity/revenue split, roles
3. **Entity formation** — LLC or simple partnership
4. **Sponsorship outreach** — Partner leads, Ian/Seth support
5. **Record Episode 1** — Lock in launch date

---

## The Ask

Distribution partner brings:
- Operational expertise
- Sponsorship sales capability
- Existing audience for bootstrap

In exchange for:
- Equity stake in Let's Vibe! venture
- Revenue share on sponsorships they close
- Creative input on content strategy
