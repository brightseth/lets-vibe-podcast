# Let's Vibe! - Seth + Ian Internal Alignment

**Date:** Sunday, January 26, 2026 (early AM)
**Purpose:** Align on Matt's equity structure BEFORE we present to him

---

## Where We Are

✅ **Agreed:**
- Matt should be Executive Producer
- He'll handle sponsorship sales + distribution
- We (Seth + Ian) stay 50/50 as co-founders
- Delaware C Corp is the entity

❓ **Need to decide:**
- What % equity does Matt get?
- What commission structure?
- Do we include performance bonuses?

---

## My Recommendation to You (Ian)

### **40/40/10/10 with 20% commission**

```
Seth:  40%
Ian:   40%
Matt:  10% (+ 20% commission on sponsors he brings)
Pool:  10% (future team: producer, editor, agents)
```

### Why This Works

**1. We stay in control (80%)**
- Can't be outvoted by third parties
- All creative decisions = us
- IP and brand ownership = us

**2. Matt is meaningfully invested**
- 10% is real equity (not token)
- But not so much that we regret it if he underperforms
- 20% commission = immediate incentive to sell

**3. Room to grow (10% pool)**
- We'll need a producer eventually
- Maybe hire an editor for clips
- Could bring on agents for guest booking
- Can offer equity to key contributors

**4. The math works at any scale**

At $500k revenue (conservative Year 1):
- Matt commission: $100k (20%)
- Net to company: $400k
- After $100k expenses = $300k profit
- Your take: $120k (40%)
- My take: $120k (40%)
- Matt's equity: $30k (10%)
- **Matt total: $130k** (commission + equity)

At $2M revenue (optimistic Year 2):
- Matt commission: $400k
- Net to company: $1.6M
- After expenses = $1.44M profit
- Your take: $576k
- My take: $576k
- Matt's equity: $144k
- **Matt total: $544k**

At all scales, we're aligned. Everyone benefits from growth.

## Alternative: If You Want to Keep More Equity

### **42.5/42.5/10/5 with 20% commission**

```
Seth:  42.5%
Ian:   42.5%
Matt:  10%
Pool:  5% (tighter, but still room for one key hire)
```

Gives us each 2.5% more, but less flexibility for future team.

**OR**

### **45/45/5/5 with 25% commission**

```
Seth:  45%
Ian:   45%
Matt:  5% (+ 25% commission)
Pool:  5%
```

Lower equity for Matt, higher commission. More immediate cash, less long-term ownership.

## What I Think Matt Will Say

**If we offer 10% + 20% commission:**
- He'll probably say yes immediately
- It's fair and industry-standard
- He gets immediate cash + meaningful equity

**If we offer 5% + 25% commission:**
- He might push for more equity
- Feels more like a hired gun than a partner
- Could work, but less "we're in this together" vibes

**If we offer 15%:**
- That's too much in my opinion
- We'd be giving up meaningful control
- Only makes sense if he's on-mic (he's not)

---

## My Strong Preference: 40/40/10/10

**Because:**
1. Clean math (easy to explain)
2. Fair to everyone
3. Leaves room for growth
4. Industry standard for this type of deal
5. We maintain founder control

**What we're saying to Matt:**
> "Ian and I are going 40/40 as co-founders and co-hosts. We want to give you 10% as executive producer with a 4-year vest. You'll also get 20% commission on any sponsors you bring in, so you're rewarded immediately for sales. And we're keeping a 10% pool so we can hire help as the show grows. Feel good?"

## Questions for You (Ian)

**1. Does 40/40/10/10 feel right to you?**
   - If not, what structure would you prefer?

**2. Are you comfortable with 20% commission?**
   - Some networks do 25-30%, but I think 20% is fair
   - Leaves more in the company for expenses/growth

**3. Do you want performance bonuses?**
   - Like: +2% equity if we hit $250k ARR, +2% at $500k
   - Pro: Rewards Matt for hitting targets
   - Con: More complex to track

**4. Timeline:**
   - Can we get verbal agreement this week?
   - File Delaware C Corp by Feb 1?
   - Record Episode 1 by Feb 14?

## What I Need From You

**Short version:**
Reply with: "40/40/10/10 works" or "let's do [alternative]"

**Long version (if you have concerns):**
- What equity split feels right to you?
- Any structure tweaks you'd want?
- Are you comfortable with Matt's role/compensation?

Once you confirm, I'll create a clean proposal for Matt.

## Bottom Line

I think 40/40/10/10 + 20% commission is:
- Fair to all three of us
- Preserves our founder control
- Gives Matt meaningful upside
- Industry-standard
- Easy to explain

**But you're my 50/50 partner on this. If you want different terms, I'm open.**

Let me know what you think and we'll move forward together.
