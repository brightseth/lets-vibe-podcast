## Why tez

tez is the reason this podcast exists. He's the one who told Seth to start a podcast. He's been building in the digital art / AI space when most people were still skeptical. He collects, he builds, he ships — and he's relentlessly optimistic about what's possible.

This is our first outside guest. It sets the tone for the show.
