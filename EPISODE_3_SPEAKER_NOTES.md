## Seth's Cheat Sheet — Key Things to Reference

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Matt's X post | Jan 22: "Bitcoin (2013) → NFTs (2020) → Polymarket (2024) → Vibe Coding (2026)" |
| His first build | Manus skill in Claude Code |
| nft now scale | 600K+ followers, award-winning platform |
| Art Basel | He's on the Digital Art Council |
| Celebrity angle | Kutcher actively vibecoding, Andreessen in his network |
| Sponsor targets | Anthropic, Vercel, Google, Nvidia, Replit, Stripe, Coinbase, Ledger |
| Our deal | EP, 10% equity, 20% commission — don't discuss numbers on air |
| The thesis | "When technical skills are no longer a barrier, everyone with vision becomes a builder" (Matt's quote) |

---

## Things to AVOID

- Don't discuss specific equity/financial terms on air
- Don't make it sound like an ad for nft now — keep it about the ideas
- Don't forget Ian — reference him, explain he'll be back
- Don't be too inside-baseball about the business setup

---

## Tone

This should feel like two friends who are excited about what they're building. Matt isn't a "guest" — he's a partner. The energy should be collaborative, not interview-style. Riff on each other's ideas.
