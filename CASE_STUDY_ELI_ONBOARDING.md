**Subject:** Eli Scheinman (nephew)
**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Starting Point:** Uses ChatGPT for editing, no coding experience, "tool averse"
**Ending Point:** Live website, GitHub repo, slide deck, video trailer, /vibe account

## The Stack Installed

| Tool | Purpose | Time to Setup |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Granola | Ambient meeting recording | 5 min |
| Claude Code (Opus 4.5) | Operating system for the mind | 10 min |
| Manus | Image/video generation via API | 5 min |
| Vercel | Web deployment | 10 min |
| GitHub | Code repository | 10 min |
| /vibe | Social layer for Claude Code users | 2 min |

**Total infrastructure setup:** ~45 minutes

---

## Chapter Breakdown

### Chapter 1: The Setup (0:00-0:20)
**"Tool Averse to Tool Ready"**

- Granola installation and first recording
- Claude Code installation via homebrew
- API key configuration for Manus
- Key quote: "This is an operating system for your mind"

**Teachable moment:** You don't need to understand the tools, just trust the process.

---

### Chapter 2: The Strategy Session (0:20-0:45)
**"From Fuzzy Ideas to Clear Vision"**

While Claude waits, Seth runs a consulting session:
- What entity do you want to build? (Not your name, not 101)
- Who's the audience? (Sovereign wealth, UHNW, big brands)
- What's the advisory board? (Seth, Benny, Noah, Ian Rogers, Mickey, Beeple)
- What are you offering? (Art + Technology + Capital = Culture)
- What's the secret sauce? (The speakeasy concept)

**Naming moment:** "Almost everything is a trope" → "There we go. We got the name."

**Key framework:** Art, Technology, Capital → Culture (Venn diagram)

---

### Chapter 3: The Prompt Drop (0:45-0:50)
**"Granola → Claude Code → Magic"**

1. Copy Granola transcript (full conversation)
2. Paste into Claude Code
3. Add instruction: "Please go ahead and build out this project for me. Use Manus for creating a 10 page slide deck. And make a website for me that links to this deck."
4. Let it design based on conversation context

**Key insight:** The prompt IS the conversation. No need to write a formal brief.

---

### Chapter 4: Watch It Build (0:50-1:05)
**"Claude Makes, You Watch"**

Simultaneous outputs:
- Website generated (minimal, dark, refined)
- Slide deck created via Manus
- Password-protected speakeasy section
- Social links and contact forms

**Eli's reaction:** "This looks already better than the outputs we often get from Art Basel internal teams."

---

### Chapter 5: The Plumbing (1:05-1:30)
**"GitHub + Vercel = Deployed"**

- GitHub repo created for version control
- Vercel deployment configured
- Debugging via screenshot → paste into Claude
- Live at trope.vercel.app

**Key technique:** When stuck, screenshot the error and paste into Claude Code. Ask "how should I fill this out?"

---

### Chapter 6: Iteration (1:30-1:45)
**"Keep Vibing"**

- Pull Twitter feed into website
- Add press coverage
- Refine copy and design
- Generate 15-second sizzle trailer via Manus

**Key insight:** You never stop. Every session adds something.

---

### Chapter 7: The Social Layer (1:45-2:00)
**"/vibe: Claude Code with Friends"**

- Install /vibe MCP server
- Connect with other Claude Code users
- Play tic-tac-toe across terminals
- DMs while coding

**The vision:** Social network for people in the Claude Code "K hole"

---
