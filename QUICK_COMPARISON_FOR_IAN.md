# Quick Comparison - Which Structure?

**At $500k revenue, here's what each of us makes:**

---

## Option 1: **40/40/10/10** (My recommendation)
```
Seth:  40%  ($120k)
Ian:   40%  ($120k)
Matt:  10%  ($130k total: $100k commission + $30k equity)
Pool:  10%
```
✅ We each get 40%
✅ Matt gets meaningful 10%
✅ Room for future hires (10% pool)
✅ Clean, simple math

---

## Option 2: **42.5/42.5/10/5** (If you want slightly more)
```
Seth:  42.5%  ($127.5k)
Ian:   42.5%  ($127.5k)
Matt:  10%    ($130k total)
Pool:  5%
```
✅ We each get 2.5% more
⚠️ Less room for future team

---

## Option 3: **45/45/5/5** (Lower equity for Matt, higher commission)
```
Seth:  45%  ($112.5k)
Ian:   45%  ($112.5k)
Matt:  5%   ($162.5k total: $150k commission [30%] + $12.5k equity)
Pool:  5%
```
✅ We keep 90% of equity
⚠️ Matt makes more cash, less invested long-term
⚠️ We actually make LESS because his commission is higher

---

## My take:

**Option 1 (40/40/10/10) is best.**

It's fair, industry-standard, and everyone is aligned at every revenue level.

Which one feels right to you?

**Next step:** Once you confirm, I'll draft the proposal for Matt.
