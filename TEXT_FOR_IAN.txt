Hey — want to lock in Matt's structure before we circle back to him.

My recommendation: 40/40/10/10

You:   40%
Me:    40%
Matt:  10% + 20% commission on sponsors
Pool:  10% (future producer, editor, etc)

At $500k revenue:
- You'd make $120k
- I'd make $120k
- Matt would make $130k ($100k commission + $30k equity)

Why this works:
- We stay in control (80% voting)
- Matt gets meaningful equity (not token)
- Room to hire help later (10% pool)
- Industry standard for this type of deal

Alternative if you want more: 42.5/42.5/10/5
Alternative if you want tighter: 45/45/5/5 (but then Matt gets higher commission and we actually make less)

I think 40/40/10/10 is cleanest and fairest.

Thoughts?

Once you confirm I'll draft the formal proposal for Matt.
