# THE LET'S VIBE! COMMANDMENTS

**What we've learned from great podcasts. What the vibe coding community needs. What we stand for.**

## THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

### I. Do the work before you hit record
Acquired does 80+ hours of research per episode. Dwarkesh reads everything a guest has written. We show up prepared, or we don't show up. Respect for the guest starts with homework.

### II. Chemistry over format
Ben and David finish each other's sentences. Lex gives guests space to think. The best moments happen when you forget the outline and follow curiosity. Trust the conversation.

### III. 45-60 minutes, no more
This is the SF to Palo Alto commute. Rick Rubin's book isn't 800 pages. Respect people's time. If you can't make your point in an hour, you haven't found your point.

### IV. Every episode must ship something buildable
Tutorials aren't optional. "This is interesting" isn't enough. By the end of the episode, someone should know how to build something they couldn't build before. Show, don't tell.

### V. Explain like you're talking to your creative friends—because you are
"What is MCP?" should be answerable at a dinner party. Jargon is a gate. Accessible language is respect, not dumbing down. The vibe coding community needs clarity, not gatekeeping.

### VI. Give historical context—we've seen this movie before
We're both old enough to remember the Netscape moment, the mobile moment, the social moment. Pattern recognition is our superpower. Connect the dots between Web 1.0 and what's happening now.

### VII. Guests should teach, not pitch
We dig into *how* they built it, not just *what* they built. No press tours. No launches. Masterclasses only. If someone watches our show, they should walk away with a new skill, not just inspiration.

### VIII. Weekly shipping is the discipline
This podcast is a force function for our own practice. If we're not building things worth talking about, we have nothing to say. The audience is the deadline. The work is the point.

### IX. "Acquired meets Oprah"—sophisticated but warm
We're not performing expertise. We're not bros hyping tech. We're two people who've been building for 30 years, still excited about what's possible, trying to distribute that excitement evenly.

### X. Neither of us needs to impress anyone—so we won't try
Ian interviewed Rick Rubin. Seth built Turntable.fm. We have nothing to prove. That freedom lets us ask dumb questions, admit what we don't know, and focus on making *the guest* look good.
