## 1. Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) — Tier 0

> Hey Andrej — Seth Goldstein here. I co-host Let's Vibe! with Ian Rogers (CXO of Ledger, interviewed Rick Rubin on Tetragrammaton). It's a weekly podcast about creativity in the age of AI.
>
> You coined vibe coding. We want to talk to the person who named the thing. Not just what it is — where it came from, where it's going, what it means when non-programmers suddenly have superpowers.
>
> 45 min, remote via Riverside, no prep needed. Two episodes live: letsvibe.fm
>
> Would love to find a time.

## 2. Peter Steinberger (@steipete) — Tier 1

> Hey Peter — Seth from /vibe here. Ian Rogers and I launched Let's Vibe!, a weekly pod about creativity + AI. Two episodes live at letsvibe.fm.
>
> Your arc is insane — 3 years away, come back, build OpenClaw entirely with Claude Code, go viral, get a trademark C&D from Anthropic, rebrand, keep shipping. "I ship code I don't read" is the most honest description of this moment I've heard.
>
> Would love to have you on for 45 min via Riverside. Any Thursday work?

## 3. Boris Cherny (@bcherny) — Tier 0

> Hey Boris — Seth Goldstein here. I host Let's Vibe! with Ian Rogers (Ledger CXO, ex-LVMH CDO). Weekly podcast about vibe coding and creativity.
>
> You created Claude Code and haven't written code yourself in 2+ months. That's the story. The guy who built the tool that's changing how everyone builds — what does his actual terminal look like? How do you think about shipping 22 PRs in a day?
>
> 45 min, Riverside, any Thursday. Two episodes live at letsvibe.fm — would be honored.

## 4. Simon Willison (@simonw) — Tier 1

> Hey Simon — Seth Goldstein here. Ian Rogers and I do Let's Vibe!, a weekly conversation about creativity in the age of AI (letsvibe.fm, 2 episodes live).
>
> You've been building the infrastructure layer for this moment — Datasette, LLM CLI, the plugin ecosystem. What's wild is you built these tools before "vibe coding" was a phrase, and now they're exactly what people need.
>
> Would love 45 min on Riverside — the origin story of building AI-native tools before anyone knew they needed them. Any Thursday work for you?

## 5. Gene Kogan (@genekogan) — Tier 1

> Gene! Seth here. Ian Rogers and I launched Let's Vibe! — weekly pod about creativity + AI. You're literally the reason I started vibe coding. "Just vibe code it yourself" changed my life last July.
>
> Abraham entering the 13-year covenant, the AUTOMATA exhibition, Eden as the platform — you've been thinking about autonomous creativity longer than anyone. Would love you on for 45 min to talk about ritual, intention, and what "vibe" actually means when an AI is the artist.
>
> Riverside, any Thursday. letsvibe.fm

## 6. Riley Brown (@rileybrown_ai) — Tier 2

> Hey Riley — Seth Goldstein here, co-host of Let's Vibe! with Ian Rogers. Weekly pod about vibe coding + creativity (letsvibe.fm).
>
> You're building the education layer for this movement in real-time — the TikTok tutorials, the "build a full app without writing code" content. Nobody's doing what you're doing at the pace you're doing it.
>
> Would love 45 min to talk about how you teach intuition, what a vibe coder looks like, and where this all goes. Riverside, any Thursday work?

## 7. tez (@thefunnyguysNFT) — CONFIRMATION

> Hey tez — following up on the podcast. We're two episodes in now (letsvibe.fm) and they're going great. Ready to do Episode 3 with you.
>
> Does Thursday Feb 13 work? 12pm PST / 9pm CET, via Riverside (~45 min). You were the one who said I should do a podcast in the first place — can't do the first guest episode without you.
