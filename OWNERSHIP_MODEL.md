- Guest access (Rick Rubin, LVMH network, tech ecosystem)
- Content creation (weekly episodes, tutorials)
- Brand/IP ownership (letsvibe.fm)
- Production infrastructure (Riverside, Descript, site)
- Distribution channel (/vibe, personal networks)

### Matt Medved (Executive Producer)
**What he brings:**

- Sponsorship sales expertise

---

## Recommended Structure: **Option B+** (Performance-Weighted with Higher Base)

### Equity Split

```
Seth:  40%  (co-founder, co-host, infrastructure)
Ian:   40%  (co-founder, co-host, guest access)
Matt:  10%  (exec producer base)
Pool:  10%  (future team, agents, advisors)
```

### Matt's Incentive Structure

**Base:** 10% equity (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)

**Performance Bonus Pool:** Up to 5% additional equity unlocked by milestones:
- 2% @ $250k ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- 2% @ $500k ARR
- 1% @ $1M ARR

**Commission:** 20% of gross ad/sponsor revenue he directly brings in

---

## Why This Works

### 1. **Preserves Founder Control (80%)**
- Seth + Ian maintain decision-making power
- Can't be outvoted by third parties
- IP and brand stay with creators

### 2. **Fair to Matt's Contribution**
- 10% base respects his role without over-diluting founders
- 20% commission aligns his incentives with revenue growth
- Performance bonuses reward him for making it a real business

### 3. **Industry Standard**
- Podcast networks typically give hosts 50-70% of revenue
- Exec producers at successful shows: 5-15% equity
- Commission rates: 15-25% for sponsorship sales

### 4. **Clean Math**
If the show generates $500k/year in sponsorships:
- Gross revenue: $500k
- Matt's commission: $100k (20%)
- Net to company: $400k
- Seth/Ian split: ~$160k each (40% of $400k)
- Matt equity earnings: ~$40k (10% of $400k)
- Matt total: ~$140k ($100k commission + $40k equity)

## Alternative Structures (For Comparison)

### Option A: Conservative (Your Original "Balanced & Founder-Fair")
```
Seth:  42.5%
Ian:   42.5%
Matt:  10%
Pool:  5%
```
**Commission:** 20% on ad revenue

**Pros:** Simple, founder-friendly
**Cons:** Less room for future team growth

---

### Option C: Network-Style (Lower Equity, Higher Cash)
```
Seth:  45%
Ian:   45%
Matt:  5%
Pool:  5%
```
**Commission:** 30% on ad revenue

**Pros:** Keeps equity tight, rewards sales performance
**Cons:** Matt may feel undervalued on equity side

---

### Option D: True Partnership (Equal Three-Way)
```
Seth:  33.3%
Ian:   33.3%
Matt:  33.3%
```
**No commission** (equity is the incentive)

**Pros:** Ultimate alignment, Matt is fully invested
**Cons:** You and Ian give up too much control for someone not on-mic

---

## Recommendation: Go with Option B+ (10% base + performance pool)

### Why:
1. **Fair to everyone:** Seth + Ian keep 80% as creators, Matt gets meaningful upside
2. **Aligned incentives:** Commission rewards sales, equity rewards long-term growth
3. **Room to grow:** 10% pool lets you bring on a producer, editor, or agent in the future
4. **Industry standard:** Reflects typical podcast network deals
5. **Performance-gated:** Matt earns more equity by hitting real milestones

### What to say to Matt:
> "Ian and I want to keep this founder-led since we're on-mic and bringing the guest network, but we want you meaningfully invested. We're thinking 10% equity with a 4-year vest, plus 20% commission on any sponsors you bring in. And if we hit revenue milestones, we'll unlock up to 5% more equity for you. That way we're all aligned and you're rewarded for making this a real business."
