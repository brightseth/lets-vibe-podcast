# Let's Vibe! Episode 1: The Inaugural Episode

**Hosts:** Seth Goldstein ([@seth](https://twitter.com/seth)) & Ian Rogers ([@iancr](https://twitter.com/iancr))
**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Location:** Seth in NYC (9 Orchard), Ian in Italy

## Episode Description

In this inaugural episode, Ian interviews Seth about his 30-year journey through Silicon Alley, the Netscape moment parallel with Claude Code, and the profound shift happening in how we build software. From Turntable.fm to Bright Moments to discovering autonomous AI artists, Seth shares the path that led two 50-somethings to become obsessed with vibe coding. It's a conversation about pattern recognition, imposter syndrome, and what happens when a 55-year-old sits at a piano and plays Rachmaninoff.

## Chapters

**[0:00] Introduction & Theme Song**
Two hosts in their 50s, obsessed with AI coding. Discussion of the Flintstones/Jetsons-inspired theme song created with Suno.

Claude Code and Opus 4.5 as the new Netscape. Pre-Netscape browsers: Mosaic, Omniweb, Links, Cello (Ian gets half a cookie).

**[16:00] Pattern Matching & Battle Scars**
Ian's perspective on his 13th startup. Overestimating short-term impact, underestimating long-term transformation.

**[20:00] The Oliver Sacks Analogy**
"A 55-year-old who never played music sits at a piano and plays Rachmaninoff." Seth's imposter syndrome about never learning to code.

**[24:00] Turntable.fm**
Billy Chasen, the Sticky Bits pivot, social music, and how label licensing killed a beautiful thing.

**[28:00] The Pro Tools Parallel**
Democratization of music production mirrors democratization of coding. Drake releasing on TuneCore, recording contracts getting better.

Opus 4.5 as the moment AGI appeared. Christmas 2025 cultural moment. Ian's daily texts with Rick about vibe coding.

**[45:00] Claude Bot Stories**
Seth's agent calling the IRS. Ian's email to Sixt car rental. The command line as past AND future.

**[50:00] Practical Tips & Closing**
Command+Space → Terminal → install Claude Code. Command+Shift+4 for screenshots. Silicon Alley 30th anniversary tonight.
