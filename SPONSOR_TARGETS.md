## Outreach Templates

### Standard Sponsor Inquiry

**Subject:** Sponsorship inquiry - Let's Vibe! podcast

```
Hi [NAME/TEAM],

I'm launching a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" - weekly conversations with the creators shaping AI-assisted creativity. Think TED Talks for vibe coders.

Our audience: Artists, designers, and makers learning to build with AI. Not traditional developers - these are creatives who discovered they can ship products with tools like [THEIR PRODUCT].

We launch Feb 10 with 3 episodes. Guests include [NOTABLE NAMES]. We're looking for sponsors who want to reach this growing audience.

Sponsorship starts at $1,500/episode for a 30-second read, or we can discuss presenting sponsor packages.

Would love to send over our media kit. Is there a right person to connect with about sponsorship?

Best,
Seth Goldstein

### In-Kind Partnership Request

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity - Let's Vibe! podcast

```
Hi [NAME/TEAM],

I'm launching a podcast for creative people building with AI. We're looking for gear/tool partners who want authentic integration with our show.

We'd love to feature [THEIR PRODUCT] as part of our setup and workflow. In exchange, we'd offer:
- Regular mentions in episodes
- Social content featuring the gear/tool
- Honest reviews from a creator perspective

Would this kind of partnership interest you?

Best,
Seth Goldstein

## Budget Projections

**Conservative (2 sponsors):**
- 1 Episode Sponsor @ $2K/ep x 12 episodes = $24K
- 1 Segment Sponsor @ $750/ep x 12 episodes = $9K
- Total: $33K/season

**Target (3-4 sponsors):**
- 1 Presenting Sponsor @ $5K/month x 3 months = $15K
- 2 Episode Sponsors @ $2K/ep x 12 = $48K
- In-kind value (gear, tools): ~$5K
- Total: $68K/season

**Stretch (5+ sponsors):**
- 1 Presenting Sponsor @ $7.5K/month x 3 = $22.5K
- 3 Episode Sponsors rotating @ $2K avg = $72K
- In-kind partnerships: ~$10K value
- Total: $104.5K/season

---

## Notes

- **Cursor and Supabase** are most likely to say yes quickly - prioritize
- **Anthropic** would be huge validation but harder to land - approach after 5+ episodes
- **Hardware partners** are great for in-kind but rarely pay cash
- **Podcast swap value** - swyx/Latent Space, Simon Willison's audience = free audience growth
