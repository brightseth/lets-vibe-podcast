# Let's Vibe! — Ian Onboarding

Welcome to the podcast. Here's everything you need to hit the ground running.

---

## The Concept

**A weekly conversation about creativity in the age of AI.**

45 minutes. Three segments. The length of a commute from SF to Palo Alto.

Not another tech podcast — this is for artists, musicians, writers, designers who make things and want to understand how AI changes the craft.

---

## The Format

| Segment | Time | What |
|---------|------|------|
| **The Guest** | 15 min | High-level thought leader interview. Rick Rubin, Karpathy, Andre 3000, Boris Dayma types. Tetragrammaton-style contemplative. |
| **The Vibe Check** | 15 min | You and me shooting the shit. What we built this week, tools we're excited about, hot takes. Two friends at a bar. |
| **The Tutorial** | 15 min | Hands-on deep dive. Screencast-friendly, becomes YouTube content. Could be guest, you, me, or contributor. |

## The Origin Story

You interviewed Rick Rubin on Tetragrammaton about **"The Way of Code: The Timeless Art of Vibecoding"** (September 2025).

Rick was named one of TIME's 100 Most Influential People in AI. The "vibe coding" meme went viral and he leaned in.

This podcast is the natural extension of that conversation.

## Why This Works

- Gives us an excuse to reach out to anyone doing interesting work
- Your Tetragrammaton/Rick Rubin context + my vibe coding daily practice = credibility
