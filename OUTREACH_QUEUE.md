Hi Rick,

I've been thinking a lot about Legendary producer, creativity philosopher, "The Creative Act" author and how it applies to the new wave of creative tools we're seeing with AI.

I'm starting a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" focused on creative people building with AI - not the technical side, but the human/creative side. Your perspective on creativity philosophy would be incredibly valuable.

Would you have 45 minutes for a conversation? We'd work around your schedule entirely.

Either way, thank you for shaping how I think about the creative process.

Best,
Seth Goldstein

Hey Peter,

Seth here. I'm launching a weekly podcast with Lukas Amacher called "Let's Vibe!" - it's for creative people learning to build with AI. Not another tech podcast for developers - this is specifically for artists, collectors, and creatives who want to vibe code.

Your work on Clawdbot and Clawdis is exactly the kind of story we want to tell. Would you be up for a ~45 min conversation about Clawdbot story?

Remote friendly, no prep needed - just a good chat about what you're building and thinking about.

Let me know if you're interested and we can find a time.

Best,
Seth

P.S. Loved watching Clawdbot evolve on /vibe.
