# Let's Vibe! Session Notes - Jan 14, 2026

## What We Accomplished

### Infrastructure
- **Website live at letsvibe.fm** - Next.js site with Rick Rubin "Creative Act" aesthetic
- **GitHub connected to Vercel** - Auto-deploys on push
- **Repo:** github.com/brightseth/lets-vibe-podcast

### Documentation Created
- `PRODUCTION_PLAYBOOK.md` - Full production workflow, competitor analysis, tooling
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated for Seth + Ian Rogers partnership
- `IAN_TLDR.md` - Summary sent to Ian

### Key Decisions
- **Format:** 45 min, 3 segments x 15 min each
  1. The Guest (thought leader interview)
  2. The Vibe Check (Seth & Ian chat)
  3. The Tutorial (hands-on deep dive)
- **Production stack:** Riverside ($29) + Descript ($24) + OpusClip ($29) = ~$82/mo
- **Recording:** Ledger studio in Paris when both there
