## Key Threads to Pull

1. **The Bachelor of Arts in CS** - This degree doesn't exist anymore. But it captured something true: computers are creative tools. We're coming back to that.

2. **The Pro Tools Parallel** - Ian made this analogy in Ep 1. Go deeper: he was there for the actual Pro Tools revolution. What does it feel like to see the same pattern twice?

3. **Rick Rubin Texts** - Ian mentioned Rick texts him every day about vibe coding. What are those conversations like? What is Rick building?

4. **The Davos/DLD Moment** - Ian was between DLD and Davos, met with Trudeau, Katy Perry, family offices. His insight: "The future is here, not evenly distributed - our job is to distribute it."

5. **From Consumer to Builder** - A CS degree holder who spent decades as an executive, now coding again for the first time in years. What changed?
