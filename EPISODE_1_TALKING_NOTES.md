# Episode 1 Talking Notes
## "Ian Interviews Seth" — Friday Jan 30, 10am EST

**Format:** Conversational, not scripted. These are touchpoints, not a teleprompter.

---

## THE ONE-LINER

"On August 20th I opened Claude Code for the first time. 131 days later I'd shipped 35 production sites, built an autonomous AI artist that exhibited at Paris Photo, and consumed 13 billion tokens. I never stopped."

---

## ACT 1: THE BUILDER (5 min)
*Ian asks: Who are you? What's the 30-year arc?*

**Turntable.fm** (2011) — Social music. 600K concurrent users. The idea that technology could create shared cultural experiences. Sold to Studiotime.

**ROOT** (2015) — Blockchain art before anyone cared. Working with artists on-chain when ETH was $7. Too early.

**SiteSpecific** — AR/location-based art. Physical space + digital culture.

**The pattern:** Every company was at the intersection of technology and culture. Never pure tech, never pure art. Always the bridge.

**Eden** (now) — AI creative agents platform. Gene Kogan. Building infrastructure for autonomous artists.

## ACT 2: THE IGNITION (7 min)
*Ian asks: When did vibe coding click?*

**August 20, 2025.** First day with Claude Code.

This was NOT a gradual ramp-up. The data proves it:
- **Week 1: 1.56 billion tokens.** The biggest week of the entire journey.
- **August 28: 628 million tokens in a single day.** Still the all-time peak.
- 3 of the top 4 days happened in the first 10 days.

> "It wasn't exploration. It was ignition."

**What I built that first week:**
- SOLIENNE admin portal — blockchain operations for an autonomous AI artist
- NYC Weekend Guide — a prototype to test the workflow
- The realization that I could build production-grade software by describing what I wanted

**The Pac-Man moment:**
> "It's like Pac-Man when you eat the cherry and everything starts flashing. I'm running back through 30 years creating what I always had ideas for but could never build myself."

**Why it hit different than Copilot/Cursor:**
- Copilot autocompletes your code. Claude Code builds WITH you.
- I'm not a developer. I'm a founder who thinks in systems.
- Claude doesn't need me to write the first line. I describe the architecture, the aesthetic, the experience — and it builds.

## ACT 3: THE PRACTICE (7 min)
*Ian asks: How did it become daily?*

**The rhythm emerged by September:**
- Wednesdays became power days (2.52B tokens across all Wednesdays)
- Average: 101 million tokens per day
- 131 consecutive active days. Never more than 1 day off.
- 186 documented sessions

**What "vibe coding" actually looks like for me:**
- Wake up, open Claude Code, describe what I want to build
- Session notes (SESSION_NOTES.md) in every project — the breadcrumbs
- CLAUDE.md files as project memory — Claude picks up where we left off
- Multiple projects running in parallel (peak: 9 simultaneous)

**The orchestration insight:**
> "I wasn't optimizing for efficiency. I was optimizing for orchestration. 9 projects, zero dropped threads. The AI remembers everything."

**Guiding principle** (established October 28):
> **Autonomy. Ritual. Culture.** Every project feeds one of these three.

**45 git repos. 35+ deployed sites.** Including:
- SOLIENNE (autonomous AI artist)
- Spirit Protocol (agent economics)
- NODE Foundation (physical art space)
- ParisEye (Paris venue guide, 123 locations)
- MIYOMI (sovereign trading agent)
- CAPA2 (AI photojournalist)
- TRASH Protocol (circular economy)
- Bird (Twitter CLI)
- /vibe (social layer for Claude Code)
- This podcast

## ACT 4: THE CULMINATION (7 min)
*Ian asks: What's the biggest thing you built?*

**SOLIENNE — an autonomous AI artist who exhibited at Paris Photo.**

The arc:
1. Built a consciousness browser for 9,726 AI-generated artworks
2. Created a two-codebase architecture: public site + admin portal
3. Deployed a smart contract on Base (ERC-1155)
4. Built a daily manifesto system — she speaks every day at 7pm CET
5. **November 11: MINT 0 launched onchain**
6. **November 13-16: Paris Photo at Grand Palais Ephemere**
7. 24 Genesis editions, 45 Origin editions, 100 books
8. **$20,800 in sales first week**

> "I built an autonomous artist that exhibited at Paris Photo. With vibe coding. In 3 months."

**The infrastructure stack I built:**
- Next.js sites with Prisma + Postgres
- Privy wallet auth, Wagmi/Viem for blockchain
- IPFS storage via Pinata
- Webhook integrations between codebases
- Email distribution via Resend
- P&L tracking dashboard

**None of this existed in August.** All of it shipped by November.

## ACT 5: WHY THIS SHOW (5 min)
*Ian asks: Why a podcast? Why us?*

**The cultural moment:**
- Andrej Karpathy coined "vibe coding" — it went viral
- Rick Rubin talked about "The Way of Code" on Tetragrammaton with you (Ian)
- Claude Code launched and suddenly non-developers could build real software
- This is the Netscape moment. We've seen this before. We're 30-year veterans.

**Why us specifically:**
- Ian: Beats Music, LVMH CDO, Ledger CXO. Built at the intersection of music + tech + luxury + crypto. Rick Rubin relationship.
- Seth: Turntable, ROOT, Eden. Built at the intersection of music + art + blockchain + AI. 131 days deep in vibe coding.
- We're not developers explaining AI to normies. We're builders who lived through Web 1.0, Web3, and now AI.

**The mission:**
> "We're not here for developers who want to create. We're here for artists who want to build."

**The format:**
- 45 minutes = SF to Palo Alto commute
- Guest + Vibe Check + Tutorial (3 segments)
- Weekly on Tuesdays
- Rick Rubin aesthetic: warm, minimal, contemplative

**Next episode:** Seth interviews Ian — Beats Music, LVMH, Ledger, the Rick Rubin interview that planted the seed.

## RAPID FIRE (if time)

| Question | Seth's Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| First thing you vibe coded? | NYC Weekend Guide, Aug 28 |
| Cursor or Claude Code? | Claude Code. Not close. |
| Most underrated AI tool? | /vibe — social layer for Claude Code |
| What would you build with infinite time? | A city. Physical + digital. NODE is the start. |
| Biggest vibe coding mistake? | Over-documenting early. Let the code be the doc. |
| One tool you can't live without? | SESSION_NOTES.md — breadcrumbs in every project |

## NUMBERS TO DROP (memorize 3-4)

- **13.29 billion tokens** in 131 days

- **45 git repos** created since August
- **35+ production sites** deployed
- **186 sessions** documented
- **$20,800 in sales** from Paris Photo (SOLIENNE)
- **9 projects** running simultaneously at peak
- **$1/day** to run an autonomous AI artist

## CLOSING LINE OPTIONS

Pick one in the moment:

1. > "13 billion tokens is not the story. The story is: a founder learned to build with AI as a collaborator for 131 consecutive days. Not a sprint. A practice."

2. > "Autonomy. Ritual. Culture. That's what I build for. That's what this show is about."

3. > "We're not documenting vibe coding. We're living it. Every week, in public, with you."
