## Side-by-Side at $500k Revenue

## At $2M Revenue (Optimistic Year 2)

| Metric | Option A | Option B | Option C | Option D |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Seth take** | $576k | $612k | $540k | $533k |
| **Ian take** | $576k | $612k | $540k | $533k |
| **Matt take** | $580k | $460k+ | $810k | $533k |

**Key insight:** As revenue grows, commission-heavy models (Option C) pay Matt more but leave less for Seth/Ian. Equity-heavy models (Option A) balance short and long-term value.

---

## Recommendation: **Option A** (40/40/10/10)

### Why:
1. **Fair to everyone** - Seth + Ian keep founder control, Matt gets meaningful upside
2. **Industry standard** - Mirrors successful podcast partnerships
3. **Room to grow** - 10% pool lets you hire a producer, editor, or bring on agents later
4. **Aligned incentives** - Equity makes Matt care about long-term value, commission rewards immediate sales
5. **Simple** - Easy to explain, easy to manage, no complex milestone tracking

### What to say to Matt:
> "Ian and I are thinking 40/40 between us as co-hosts and creators. We'd love to give you 10% as executive producer, with a 20% commission on sponsorships you bring in. That way you're invested in the long-term success but also rewarded immediately for sales. We're keeping a 10% pool so we can bring on help as we grow. Does that feel fair?"

## The Real Test: $0 Revenue Scenario

What if the show doesn't take off in Year 1?

| Option | What Matt Gets |
|--------|----------------|
| **A** | 10% equity, $0 commission |
| **B** | 5% equity, $0 commission |
| **C** | 5% equity, $0 commission |
| **D** | 33.3% equity, $0 commission |

**Option A is fairest here** - Matt's 10% equity stake means he's invested even if revenue is slow. In Option C, he'd have almost nothing. In Option D, he'd have huge equity but might resent the time investment if there's no revenue.

## Podcast Industry Comps

**Typical Host Equity:**
- Solo shows: 100% (Lenny's Podcast, Tim Ferriss)
- Co-hosted indie shows: 50/50 (Acquired)
- Network shows: 30-50% to hosts, rest to network (Wondery, Stitcher)

**Typical Producer/EP Equity:**
- 5-15% for executive producers
- 2-5% for line producers
- Usually with commission on ad sales (15-25%)

**Your deal (Option A):**
- Hosts: 80% (high, but you're also funding it)
- EP: 10% (fair)
- Commission: 20% (industry standard)

---

*Bottom line: Option A is clean, fair, and industry-standard. Go with it.*
