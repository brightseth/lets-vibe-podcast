# Let's Vibe! - Video Promo Concepts

**Purpose:** Creative briefs for video content to promote the podcast
**Brand Essence:** TED Talks for vibe coders - warm, sophisticated, creative, accessible
**Visual Identity:** Copper/magenta sculptural forms on black, Skulptuur energy

---

## 1. Launch Trailer (60s)

### Concept: "The Future Is Being Built by Creatives"

A cinematic introduction to the podcast that establishes the mission and tone. Not a tech podcast trailer - a creativity-first invitation.

### Visual Style

**Aesthetic:** Warm, flowing, artistic. Think David Fincher meets abstract generative art.

**Color Palette:**
- Deep black backgrounds (#0A0A0A)
- Copper/rose gold accents (matching cover art)
- Magenta highlights
- Subtle cyan pops for contrast

**Visual Motifs:**
- Abstract flowing ribbons (callback to cover art knot sculpture)
- Code transforming into art
- Hands creating on screens
- Intimate studio moments

### Structure & Text Overlays

| Time | Visual | Text Overlay | Audio |
|------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 0-5s | Sculptural knot form emerging from black | - | Ambient tone, building |
| 5-12s | Quick cuts: Claude Code terminal, Midjourney output, hands typing | "Something is happening..." | Soft electronic pulse |
| 12-18s | Abstract code morphing into visual art | "Artists are becoming builders" | Music intensifies |
| 18-25s | Diverse creators at screens (stock/generated) | "Builders are becoming artists" | - |
| 25-32s | Preview clips from episodes (or recreated moments) | "Every week, we talk to the people making it happen" | Guest voice snippets |
| 32-42s | Cover art reveal with hosts | "LET'S VIBE!" | Theme music hook |
| 42-50s | Montage: laughter, insight moments, creative tools | "with Seth and Lukas" | - |
| 50-55s | Episode preview clips | "New episodes every Monday" | Music resolution |
| 55-60s | Full logo, subscribe buttons | "Subscribe now" | Tagline VO |

### Music/Audio Direction

- **Style:** Electronic ambient with organic warmth (think Jon Hopkins meets Tycho)
- **Arc:** Builds from minimal to inspiring
- **Avoid:** Aggressive EDM, corporate inspiration music, generic podcast intros
- **Voice Over:** Optional Seth VO for key lines, or text-only

### B-Roll Suggestions

**To Generate with Veo 3:**
- Abstract flowing ribbons in copper/magenta
- Code terminal with colorful syntax transforming to particle art
- Hands gesturing while speaking (warm lighting)
- Split-screen creativity: left side code, right side output

**Stock/Existing:**
- AI art generation timelapses
- Studio/creator workspace shots
- Abstract data visualization

## 5. "What is Vibecoding?" Explainer (90s)

### Concept: Educational Entry Point

A standalone explainer video that can be used for paid promotion, homepage, and onboarding new listeners. Answers the question every newcomer has.

### Target Audience

- Creative professionals curious about AI
- Designers, artists, musicians who've heard about "vibe coding"
- People who feel intimidated by traditional coding
- Anyone who saw the Andrej Karpathy clip

### Key Points to Cover

1. **Definition** (15s): What vibecoding actually is
2. **Origin** (10s): Karpathy coined it, what he meant
3. **Who it's for** (20s): Creatives, not just developers
4. **How it works** (25s): Natural language to creation
5. **Examples** (15s): What people are building
6. **Invitation** (10s): Join the movement via the podcast

### Script Structure

```
[0-5s]
HOOK: "You don't need to learn to code anymore."

[5-20s]
DEFINITION: "Vibecoding is using AI to build things by describing
what you want in plain English. No syntax. No debugging.
Just... vibing with the machine."

[20-30s]
ORIGIN: "The term comes from Andrej Karpathy, former AI lead at Tesla.
He described it as 'fully giving in to the vibes' -
letting AI handle the technical details while you focus on what matters."

[30-50s]
WHO: "This isn't about software developers. It's about artists
creating interactive experiences. Musicians building tools.
Designers shipping products. Founders prototyping in hours, not months.
If you can describe it, you can build it."

[50-65s]
HOW: [Screen demo montage]
"You talk to AI like a collaborator. 'Make me a website that...'
'Build an app that...' 'Create a tool that...'
And it just... does it."

[65-80s]
EXAMPLES: [Quick montage]
"A collector built a gallery site in an afternoon.
An artist created an interactive installation.
A musician made a sample library tool.
All without writing a single line of code themselves."

[80-90s]
CTA: "Let's Vibe! is the podcast for creative people learning
to build with AI. New episodes every Monday."
[Logo + Subscribe]
```

### Visual Metaphors

| Concept | Visual |
|---------|--------|
| "Old way" of coding | Dark terminal, matrix-style code rain |
| "New way" vibecoding | Warm, flowing, collaborative |
| Natural language | Speech bubbles transforming into interfaces |
| Creative output | Diverse art/tools/products emerging |
| AI collaboration | Two entities (human + AI) creating together |

### Visual Style

**Opening:**
- Start with intimidating code (cold, blue)
- Transform to warm, accessible aesthetic
- Mirror the emotional journey of discovery

**Main body:**
- Clean, well-lit spaces
- Diverse creators (not just tech bros)
- Warm color palette (copper, cream, soft black)
- Show real tools: Claude Code, Cursor, etc.

**Demo sections:**
- Screen recordings with soft vignette
- Typing with visible natural language
- Output appearing "magically"

**Closing:**
- Full podcast branding
- Community feeling (multiple creators)
- Invitation energy

### Audio Direction

- **Voice:** Warm, confident, accessible (Seth VO or hire)
- **Music:** Builds from minimal to inspiring
- **Sound design:** Subtle UI sounds, transformation moments
- **Avoid:** Corporate inspiration music, aggressive tones

### Text Overlays

| Moment | Text | Style |
|--------|------|-------|
| Definition | "VIBECODING" | Large, animated reveal |
| Key quote | "Fully giving in to the vibes" | Quote card treatment |
| Who | "Artists. Musicians. Designers. Founders." | Sequential reveal |
| CTA | "New episodes every Monday" | Clean, persistent |

### Dimensions

| Platform | Dimensions | Use Case |
|----------|------------|----------|
| YouTube | 16:9 (1920x1080) | Primary, ads |
| Website | 16:9 (1920x1080) | Homepage embed |
| Twitter/X | 16:9 (1920x1080) | Pinned/promoted |
| TikTok | 9:16 (1080x1920) | Organic/paid |
| Instagram | 9:16 (1080x1920) | Reels/ads |

### Production Approach

**Option A: Fully Generated**
- Use Veo 3 for all footage
- Generate diverse creators, spaces, screens
- AI voice (ElevenLabs) or Seth VO
- Timeline: 2-3 days

**Option B: Hybrid**
- Generate abstract/metaphor sequences with Veo 3
- Screen recordings of actual tools
- Stock footage for human elements
- Seth voiceover
- Timeline: 1 week

**Option C: Full Production**
- Hire videographer for creator B-roll
- Professional VO talent
- Custom motion graphics
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks

### Recommended: Option B (Hybrid)

Best balance of quality, authenticity, and speed. Screen recordings prove the concept is real, generated visuals handle the abstract/aspirational moments.

### Production Tools

- **Generative video:** Veo 3 (primary), Runway Gen-3 (backup)
- **Screen recording:** OBS, ScreenFlow
- **Editing:** DaVinci Resolve
- **Motion graphics:** After Effects
- **Voice:** Seth VO or ElevenLabs
- **Music:** Artlist or commission
- **Stock (if needed):** Pexels, Artgrid

### Distribution Strategy

1. **YouTube:** Full version, SEO-optimized title
2. **Paid ads:** Cut to 30s and 15s versions
3. **Website:** Embed on letsvibe.show homepage
4. **Social:** Organic posts on all platforms
5. **Podcast:** Audio version as episode intro
