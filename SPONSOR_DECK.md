# Let's Vibe! Sponsor Deck

**Weekly podcast for creative folks learning to vibe code**

---

## The Opportunity

A new creative movement is emerging. Artists, designers, and makers are discovering they can build software—not by learning to code the traditional way, but by *vibing* with AI. They describe what they want, iterate in conversation, and ship real products.

**Let's Vibe!** is the first podcast dedicated to this culture. We're documenting the vibecoding revolution as it happens, sharing workflows, interviewing practitioners, and building a community of creative technologists.

## Why Let's Vibe!

### First Mover Advantage
No other podcast focuses specifically on vibecoding culture. We're documenting a movement, not chasing a trend.

### Authentic Voice
Seth and Lukas are practitioners, not pundits. They ship projects weekly, contribute to open source, and build in public. The audience trusts them because they're in the arena.

### Ecosystem Integration
Let's Vibe! isn't standalone—it's part of a larger ecosystem:

- **vibecodings**: Directory of 57+ vibecoded projects
- **/vibe**: Social layer for Claude Code users (500+ active)
- **Spirit Protocol**: Infrastructure for autonomous creative agents
- **NODE Foundation**: Physical art + technology community

### Quality Over Hype
We focus on what actually works, not what sounds impressive. Our audience is allergic to AI hype and gravitates toward honest, practical content.

### Community-First
Listeners become contributors. Projects featured on the show get submitted to vibecodings. Guests become community members. Sponsors become part of the story.
