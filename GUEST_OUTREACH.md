## Draft Outreach Messages

### 1. Peter Steinberger (Warm - /vibe Connection)

**Platform:** Twitter DM or /vibe

```
Hey Peter! Seth here from /vibe.

I'm launching a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" with Lukas Amacher - it's TED Talks for vibe coders. Weekly conversations with the people shaping AI-assisted creativity.

You're literally one of the first people I thought of. Clawdbot/Clawdis is exactly the kind of thing we want to highlight - tools that democratize what's possible with AI. Plus your iOS background gives you a unique lens.

Would you be up for a ~45 min remote conversation? No prep needed - just a good chat about what you're building and thinking about.

We're recording first episodes end of January. Let me know if you're interested and we can find a time that works.
```

### 2. Gene Kogan (Personal Contact)

**Platform:** Direct message/email

```
Gene,

Starting a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" - weekly conversations with creators shaping AI-assisted creativity. Think TED Talks for vibe coders.

You were one of the first names on my list. Abraham.ai and your thinking on autonomous art is exactly the philosophical depth we want to bring to this. Too many AI podcasts are surface-level hype - we're going for Acquired meets Oprah.

45 minutes, remote, whenever works for you. Would love to have you on.

What do you think?

Seth
```

### 3. Simon Willison (Cold - Reference His Work)

**Platform:** Twitter DM

```
Hi Simon,

Huge fan of your work - your blog posts on LLM tools are the best resource out there. The Datasette philosophy of making data accessible has been influential on how I think about AI tools.

I'm launching a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" - weekly conversations with people building at the intersection of AI and creativity. Not a developer podcast - it's for creatives learning to build with AI.

Your perspective on making AI tools accessible would be perfect. Would you be up for a ~45 min conversation? Remote, no prep, just exploring your thinking.

Either way, thank you for everything you put out there.

Seth
```

### 4. swyx (Podcast Swap Pitch)

**Platform:** Twitter DM

```
Hey Shawn,

Love Latent Space - it's in my regular rotation.

I'm launching "Let's Vibe!" - a weekly podcast for creative people learning to build with AI. Different angle from Latent Space - we're targeting artists and makers, not engineers.

Would love to explore a podcast swap at some point. I think there's minimal audience overlap (creative vibe coders vs. AI engineers) but maximum value for both audiences.

For starters - would you be interested in coming on to talk about learning in public and how the AI landscape is evolving?

Seth
```

### 5. Riley Brown (Fellow Creator)

**Platform:** Twitter DM

```
Hey Riley,

Your Claude content is great - you make AI approachable in a way most don't.

I'm launching a podcast called "Let's Vibe!" with Lukas Amacher. Weekly conversations with people in the vibe coding space - TED Talks for creative AI builders.

You'd be a perfect guest. Would love to talk about your journey into AI education, what you're learning from your audience, and where you see vibe coding going.

45 min, remote, casual conversation. Interested?

Seth
```
