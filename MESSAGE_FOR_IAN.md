# WhatsApp Message Draft for Ian

---

## Message Option 1: Direct

Hey! Got your voice messages - I'm fully in on this. Created the Ten Commandments you asked for:

**https://slashvibe.dev/a/the-let-s-vibe-ten-commandments**

Based on what makes Acquired, Dwarkesh, and Lex great + what we uniquely bring.

Let's record Episode 1 next week while you're in Italy and I'm in NY. Riverside works perfectly for remote.

**Proposed time: 9am NY / 3pm Italy** (pick any day that week that works)

You interview me first (Turntable → /vibe → vibe coding moment), then we flip it for Episode 2.

Thoughts?

## Message Option 2: Conversational

Yo - loved the vision from your voice note. "Distribute AI superpowers evenly" like Tony Hawk skate parks = perfect mission.

Made the Ten Commandments: **https://slashvibe.dev/a/the-let-s-vibe-ten-commandments**

Top ones:
- Do the work (Acquired-level prep)
- Ship something buildable (tutorials mandatory)
- Historical context (our 30 years = superpower)
- Nothing to prove (freedom to be real)

Let's do Episode 1 next week. You in Italy, me in NY, Riverside remote = easy.

9am NY / 3pm Italy work? Any day that week.

## Message Option 3: Brief

Created the Ten Commandments:
**https://slashvibe.dev/a/the-let-s-vibe-ten-commandments**

Let's record Episode 1 next week - you interview me, then we flip it.

9am NY / 3pm Italy? Pick a day.

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (conversational, includes mission callback, specific without being too formal)
